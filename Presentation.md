### Architecture Flow Explanation

#### **Scaling Components Integration**:
1. **KEDA (Event-Driven Autoscaler)**:
   - Monitors Kafka queue depth for traffic prediction
   - Uses Prometheus custom metrics for business-specific scaling
   - Triggers proactive scaling before traffic spikes hit

2. **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**:
   - Handles CPU/memory-based reactive scaling
   - Configured for aggressive scaling (900% increase in 15 seconds)
   - Works with warm pool baseline (3 replicas minimum)

3. **VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)**:
   - Optimizes resource requests/limits for native images
   - Reduces memory usage by 50-70% compared to JVM

4. **Cluster Autoscaler**:
   - Adds/removes nodes based on pod scheduling demands
   - Supports spot instances for cost optimization


## Slide 5: Core Scaling Strategy: Scaling Strategy - Phase 1

- **CPU**: 100m request, 500m limit
- **Cost**: ~$75-150/month for 24/7 warm pool

---

## Slide 6: Core Scaling Strategy: Scaling Strategy - Phase 2

## Slide 8: Core Scaling Strategy: Node Scaling Architecture

### Multiple Node Pool Strategy

#### Standard Node Pool (Baseline)
- **Configuration**: 5 nodes distributed across all availability zones
- **Instance Types**: m5.large/m5.xlarge for cost-optimized steady-state operations
- **Purpose**: Handle normal traffic loads with consistent performance
- **Scaling**: Minimal scaling, maintains baseline capacity

#### Burst Node Pool (Traffic Spikes)
- **Configuration**: Dedicated scaling pool for 25x traffic scenarios
- **Instance Types**: m5.2xlarge/m5.4xlarge for higher pod density (up to 110 pods per node)
- **Purpose**: Rapid horizontal scaling during traffic spikes
- **Scaling**: 0-20 nodes based on demand

### Cloud Provider Considerations
- **Limits**: VM service limits, VPC limits (request increases proactively)
- **Instance Selection**: Memory-optimized for native Java applications
- **Network Performance**: Enhanced networking for high-throughput scenarios
- **Availability Zones**: Multi-AZ distribution for fault tolerance

### Warm Node Pool Implementation

- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances for burst scenarios (60-70% cost savings)
- **Auto-termination**: Scale down unused nodes after 10 minutes of low utilization

### Cluster Autoscaler Configuration
- **Node Groups**: Separate scaling policies for standard vs burst pools
- **Scale-up**: Aggressive scaling (new nodes in 60-90 seconds)
- **Scale-down**: Conservative approach (10-minute delay) to avoid thrashing
- **Resource Limits**: Configure cloud provider quotas for 25x scaling capacity

---

## Slide 9: Core Scaling Strategy: Scale-Down Strategy & Graceful Termination

- **Health Check Coordination**: Update readiness probe to fail immediately on shutdown signal

### Scale-Down Timeline & Phases

#### Phase 1: Preparation (0-10 seconds)
- **Signal Reception**: Pod receives SIGTERM signal from Kubernetes
- **Traffic Stopping**: Update readiness probe to fail, stop accepting new requests
